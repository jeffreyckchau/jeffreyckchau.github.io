My name is Jeffrey Chau. I am a Junior at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science (Games), averaging a major GPA of 3.7. I have been gaming for just under two decades, having started playing on a Nintendo 64 and original Gameboy handheld. Nowadays I play League of Legends, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and a bunch of console games (favorites being the Legend of Zelda and Super Smash). I have been coding for four years and making games for five. Outside of the electronic world, I enjoy fencing, classical and non-classial music, and cooking.
